Duy Huynh is a film page created by Duy Huynh for FER201m (Front-end with React) course at FPT University. Most of the web leverages React library and component design (MUI and Materialize). Front-end framework being used throughout the project is TailwindCSS. Besides, for fetching and auditing data, I use MockAPI.io.
